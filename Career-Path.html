      </div>
      <p id="SACP">A security analyst is a pretty broad job description that refers to people responsible for monitoring computer
        infrastructure and information networks to ensure the are protected. <br><br>
        The job responsibilities for a security analyst can range from controlling file access and credentialing, to
        maintaining firewalls and network updates, to proactively trying to hack systems to look for vulnerabilities and
        weaknesses. <br><br>
        Four steps to becoming a security analyst:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Research: </b>The good news is that the opportunities under the position of cybersecurity analysts and
          the
          number of new types of jobs are constantly evolving, giving cybersecurity professionals many career
          opportunities to properly position themselves. That is what we are offering. Therefore, the first step in
          becoming a cybersecurity analyst is to understand the type of work you want to perform and map it to the type
          of training and certification you need. Even entry-level security analyst positions can require specialized
          training, so it's best to plan ahead.</li><br>
        <li><b>Education: </b>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), most cybersecurity analysts have a
          bachelor's degree in cybersecurity (or a closely related field like math, computer science, or engineering).
          However, in some cases, with appropriate cybersecurity certifications (see next point), security professionals
          with a college degree and/or related education or background (such as military service). example) have a need
          to be able to secure entry-level private sector cybersecurity jobs</li><br>
        <li><b>Certification: </b>One thing that distinguishes cybersecurity from other professions is that many jobs -
          both beginner and intermediate - require some level of certification that shows proficiency in a particular
          skill type. When planning a career in cybersecurity, you should pay attention to the types of certifications
          required for different jobs in the field.</li><br>
        <li><b>4. Network: </b>An important part of training to become a security analyst is to build a professional
          network. A network that targets a specific career path helps you stay on top of the latest trends and
          opportunities in the industry.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><b> Step 1:</b> To become a cybersecurity analyst you need to earn a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity,
          information technology, computer science, or a related field</li>
        <li><b> Step 2:</b> Complete an internship to obtain experience in a computer related field</li>
        <li><b> Step 3:</b> Gain special credentials by obtaining certification</li>
        <li><b> Step 4:</b> Pursue an entry-level position in general IT or security</li>
      </ul>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-right"><span class="border border-primary"></span>Penetration tester</h2>
      </div>
      <p id="PTCP">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Self-analysis:</b> Penetration testing is not for everyone. It requires extraordinary problem-solving
          skills, tenacious determination, attention to detail, and a desire to keep up with the latest trends in the
          field. Successful ethical hackers need to have a high level of each of these traits in order to excel.
          Therefore, be honest with your self-assessment before deciding whether a penetration test is a good
          profession. </li><br>
        <li><b>Education:</b> In the past, it was known that many employers hired real hackers and converted them from
          the “dark side” to work for the good. However, in recent years, penetration testers are almost obliged to have
          a college degree. Bachelor’s degrees in various cybersecurity disciplines all provide a practical entry point
          into the field. </li><br>
        <li><b>Career Path:</b> There are several ways for anyone who wants a penetration test to enter the
          cybersecurity industry. An overview of security management, network management, network engineers, system
          administrators, or web-based application programming. This always focuses on the security side of each area
          and provides a good foundation for penetration testing. </li><br>
        <li><b>Professional Qualifications:</b> Employers primarily want to see various professional qualifications
          related to warranty validator resumes. This is especially true for senior positions. Currently, several
          organizations offer widely recognized accreditations for penetration testing professions.</li><br>
        <li><b>Hone Your Techniques:</b> Becoming an expert in your chosen field is a good idea for any career, but
          there are several ways for penetration testers to stand out from the crowd. Pentesters who are active and
          recognized in cybersecurity areas such as bug bounty programs, open source intelligence (OSINT) collection,
          and developing their own attack programs are recognized by peer groups.</li><br>
        <li><b>Stay up to date:</b> As with most cybersecurity career paths, it’s important to keep up with what’s
          happening in the industry. Keep your skills and knowledge up-to-date with the latest trends in programming and
          network security, ever-changing hacking technologies and security protocols, commonly exploited
          vulnerabilities, and everything else happening in the cybersecurity industry. </li><br>
      </ul>
