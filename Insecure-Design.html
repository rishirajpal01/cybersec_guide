        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The Insecure design category maps 40 CWEs that are related to input valuation errors, proper usage of
          application APIs and functions, privilege management issues and IDOR vulnerabilities, security of
          communication with the application, secure storage of sensitive information. <br><br>
          This new OWASP category anticipates broad negotiations with business and implementation of threat modeling
          stage in order to anticipate attack vectors and properly protect the web application.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective
          control design.” Insecure design is not the source for all other Top 10 risk categories. There is a difference
          between insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and implementation
          defects for a reason, they have different root causes and remediation. A secure design can still have
          implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by
          a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against
          specific attacks. One of the factors that contribute to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling
          inherent in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to determine what level of security
          design is required.</p>

        <h3>Requirements and Resource Management</h3>
        <p>Collect and negotiate the business requirements for an application with the business, including the
          protection requirements concerning confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of all data
          assets and the expected business logic. Take into account how exposed your application will be and if you need
          segregation of tenants (additionally to access control). Compile the technical requirements, including
          functional and non-functional security requirements. Plan and negotiate the budget covering all design, build,
          testing, and operation, including security activities.</p>

        <h3>Secure Design</h3>
        <p>Secure design is a culture and methodology that constantly evaluates threats and ensures that code is
          robustly designed and tested to prevent known attack methods. Threat modeling should be integrated into
          refinement sessions (or similar activities); look for changes in data flows and access control or other
          security controls. In the user story development determine the correct flow and failure states, ensure they
          are well understood and agreed upon by responsible and impacted parties. Analyze assumptions and conditions
          for expected and failure flows, ensure they are still accurate and desirable. Determine how to validate the
          assumptions and enforce conditions needed for proper behaviors. Ensure the results are documented in the user
          story. Learn from mistakes and offer positive incentives to promote improvements. Secure design is neither an
          add-on nor a tool that you can add to software.</p>

        <h3>Secure Development Lifecycle</h3>
        <p>Secure software requires a secure development lifecycle, some form of secure design pattern, paved road
          methodology, secured component library, tooling, and threat modeling. Reach out for your security specialists
          at the beginning of a software project throughout the whole project and maintenance of your software. Consider
          leveraging the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) to help structure your secure software
          development efforts.</p>

        <h3>How to prevent?</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Establish and use a secure development lifecycle with AppSec professionals to help evaluate and design security and privacy-related controls </li>
            <li> Establish and use a library of secure design patterns or paved road ready to use components</li>
            <li> Use threat modeling for critical authentication, access control, business logic, and key flows</li>
            <li> Integrate security language and controls into user stories</li>
            <li> Integrate plausibility checks at each tier of your application (from frontend to backend)</li>
            <li> Write unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows are resistant to the threat model. Compile </li>use-cases *and* misuse-cases for each tier of your application.
            <li> Segregate tier layers on the system and network layers depending on the exposure and protection needs</li>
            <li> Segregate tenants robustly by design throughout all tiers</li>
            <li> Limit resource consumption by user or service</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Example Attack Scenarios</h3>
        <p><b style="font-size: x-large;"> Scenario:</b> A credential recovery workflow might include “questions and answers,” which is prohibited by NIST 800-63b, the OWASP ASVS, and the OWASP Top 10. Questions and answers cannot be trusted as evidence of identity as more than one person can know the answers, which is why they are prohibited. Such code should be removed and replaced with a more secure design.
